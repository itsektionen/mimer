Mimer is a _well of knowledge_, a single _source of thruth_,
which can be consumed by applications.

Right now, it only provides information about

## Yaak

If you are using [Yaak](https://yaak.app/) for local API testing you can find workspace files in `yaak/` so you do not have to write requests for all endpoints manually.
